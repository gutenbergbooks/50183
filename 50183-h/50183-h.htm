<h2><a name="THRIFT_AND_UNTHRIFT" id="THRIFT_AND_UNTHRIFT">THRIFT AND UNTHRIFT.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> lately said a word on Rich Folks, hinting that
so far from being the monsters of iniquity which
moralists and preachers have for ages denounced
them, they are, taken all in all, public benefactors;
for without the accumulation of wealth, by means
of thrift and honest enterprise, the world would
still have been in a deplorably backward condition.
Riches are of course comparative. An artisan who
by savings and diligence in his calling has insured
for himself a competence for old age, is doubtless
rich and respectable. Doing his best, and with
something to the good, he is worthy of our esteem.
What he has laid aside in a spirit of economy goes
to an augmentation of the national wealth. In a
small way he is a capitalist&mdash;his modicum of surplus
earnings helping to promote important schemes
of public interest.</p>

<p>Great Britain, with its immense field for successful
industry and enterprise, excels any country
in the capacity for saving. In almost every branch
of art there is a scope for thrift beyond what is
obtainable elsewhere. Thriftiness, however, among
the manual labouring classes was scarcely thought
of in times within living remembrance. Savings-banks
to receive spare earnings came into existence
only in the early years of the present century.
Now, spread in all directions, and established in
the army and navy, they possess deposits amounting
to nearly thirty millions sterling. Besides
these accumulations, much is consigned to Friendly
Societies; and it is pleasing to observe that within
the last twenty years, the artisan classes have
expended large sums in the purchase of dwellings
purposely erected for their accommodation. All
this looks like an advance in thrifty habits&mdash;a
stride in civilisation.</p>

<p>But after every admission of this kind has
been made, it is too certain that vast numbers
live from hand to mouth, save nothing
whatever from earnings however large, and
are ever on the brink of starvation. In this
respect, the working classes, as they are usually
styled, fall considerably below the peasantry
of France, who, though noted for their ignorance,
and for the most part unable to read,
have an extraordinary aptitude for saving; of
which there is no more significant proof than their
heavy loans to government when pressed to pay
an enormous war indemnity to Germany. As
the thrift of the French agriculturists sinks to
the character of a sordid parsimony, which is
adverse to social improvement, no political economist
can speak of it with unqualified admiration.
It only shews what can be done by two or three
things&mdash;the economical use of earnings, the economical
use of time, and the strict cultivation
of temperate habits. From each of these predominating
qualities a lesson might be judiciously
taken. Though a lively race, fond of amusement,
the French peasantry, and we may add, the
peasantry of Switzerland, know the value of time.
In them the 'gospel of idleness,' so pertinaciously
preached up by indiscreet enthusiasts, has
no adherents. In all our experience, we have
never seen such assiduity in daily labour from
early morn till eve, as among the French and
Swiss rural population. They would repudiate
any dictation of a hard and fast line as to hours.
Time is their beneficent inheritance, to make the
most of for themselves and families.</p>

<p>Pity it is that in our own country time is
so unthriftily squandered. Obviously there is a
growing disposition among the operative classes to
diminish the daily hours of labour, to the detriment
of individual and general prosperity. When
we began life, ten hours a day, or sixty in the
week, were considered a fair thing. Then came a
diminution to nine, to eight hours, along with
whole and half-holidays, but no lowering of
wages. How this is to go on, we are unable to
explain. We fear that unless something like
common-sense intervene, a degree of individual
and national disaster will ensue scarcely contemplated
by the votaries of 'St Lubbock.' In
his late speech at the opening of the Manchester
Town-hall, Mr Bright adverted to the
awkward consequences of indefinitely shortening
the hours of labour. He is reported to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">{642}</a></span>
have said: 'We have for many years past been
gradually diminishing the period of time during
which our machinery can work. We are surrounded
by a combination whose object is not
only to diminish the time of labour and the products
of labour, but to increase the remuneration
of labour. Every half an hour you diminish the
time of labour, and every farthing you raise the
payment of labour which is not raised by the
ordinary economic and proper causes, has exactly
the same effect upon us as the increase of the
tariffs of foreign countries. Thus we often find,
with all our philanthropy in wishing the people
to have more recreation, and with our anxiety
that the workman should better his condition
through his combination, that we are ourselves
aiding&mdash;it may be inevitably and necessarily&mdash;but
it is a fact that we are aiding to increase the difficulties
under which we labour in sending foreign
countries the products of the industry of these
districts; and we must bear in mind that great
cities have fallen before Manchester and Liverpool
were known; and that there have been great
cities, great mercantile cities on the shores of the
Mediterranean, the cities of Ph&#339;nicia, the cities
of Carthage, Genoa, and Venice.' Such sentiments
are worth taking to heart. The preaching up of
recreation, otherwise idleness, has gone rather too
far. We begin to perceive that wages can be paid
only in proportion to work done, and that if
people choose to amuse themselves, there must
correspondingly be a new adjustment of payments.</p>

<p>At the late meeting of the British Association,
there was some profitable discussion on work,
wages, and thrift. One speaker emphatically
pointed out that unthrift was more concerned in
producing poverty in families than a deficiency in
wages. He said, that where there was a deficiency
of food 'it would mostly be found that what was
wanted had been consumed in drink.' Adding,
'As a matter of fact, the large families did the best,
and the greatest men in science and as statesmen
were mostly members of large families and younger
sons upon whom early struggles for mental growth
had produced brilliant results.' This corresponds
with ordinary experience. Within our own knowledge,
the greater number of persons distinguished
in literature, the arts, and in commerce have been
the sons of parents whose means of bringing up
their families did not exceed a hundred, in some
instances not eighty, pounds a year. Yet upon
these slender resources, through the effects of
thrift&mdash;as, for example, the case given by the late
Sir William Fairbairn&mdash;families of six or seven
children were respectably reared, and attained
prominent places in society.</p>

<p>In almost every large town is observed a painful
but curious contrast in the administration of earnings.
On one side are seen the families of small
tradesmen making a manful struggle to keep up
respectable appearances at a free revenue of not
more than a hundred a year; while alongside of
them are families earning two pounds a week and
upwards, who make no effort at respectability, and
are constantly in difficulties. The explanation
simply lies in thrift and unthrift. In one case
there are aspirations and enlightened foresight; in
the other there is a total indifference to consequences.
A few weeks ago, the Rev. F. O. Morris,
of Nunburnholme Rectory, Hayton, York, communicated
to the <i>Times</i> some remarkable revelations
concerning unthrift. 'A gentleman of my
acquaintance,' he says, 'living in a midland
manufacturing town, gave me, two or three years
ago, the following instances of the unthriftness, or
rather the outrageous extravagance, of the artisans
there; such cases being quite common, the exceptions
only the other way. I must premise that
many of them with families were at that time
earning from eight to twelve pounds a week; a
single man as much as five pounds a week, and
yet, though paid on Saturday evenings, they would
come on the following Monday night to ask the
manager for an advance of the next week's wages.
And this not for any legitimate expenditure, for
even those who had families lived generally in one
room, kept no servant, and only employed charwomen.
Nevertheless, well they might be in
want of ready-money, for often you would see a
party setting out on a Sunday for an excursion
to some place or other in a carriage with four
horses, and dressed in the most extravagant
manner, but at the same time with much taste,
owing no doubt to their employment being in
the lace-trade.</p>

<p>'A charwoman told the wife of my informant
that she knew one married couple who can
earn seven pounds a week who often came to
her on a Thursday to borrow a shilling, their
money being all gone. They lived in two rooms,
very badly furnished. A needle-woman also
told the lady that she knew a couple who earned
eight pounds a week, or even more, between
them, who lived in two rooms wretchedly furnished,
without even a cup or saucer, besides the
two they used, to give a friend a cup of tea;
that the woman would give four or five guineas
for a dress, and had given as much as six guineas,
which she would wear all day, from the first thing
in the morning till it was shabby, when she would
buy another as expensive, or even more so, according
to the fashion. She never cooked their own
dinner, but bought the most expensive things,
took them to a public-house to be cooked, and
dined there, eating and drinking afterwards. The
"hands" in the trade of the place would often
order, for one week, black tea at 4s. a pound, and
green at 6s. Thy would also buy cucumbers at 1s.
and 1s. 6d. apiece, beefsteaks for breakfast at
1s. 3d. a pound, and would only eat them fried in
butter; salmon in like manner when it first came
in at 3s. or 4s. a pound, and lamb at a guinea a
quarter. For more light fare they would buy
oysters at 2s. or 2s. 6d. a dozen, put down gold on
the counter, and eat them as fast as a man could
open them for them. My friend saw two men
thus eat 10s. worth standing at a stall in the
market-place. A man earning L.3 a week, paid
on the Saturday evening, got into a row with the
police on the Sunday, was fined 25s. on the
Monday, and not one out of a hundred or more
of his fellow-workmen could advance him the
money to pay the fine with, and he had to borrow
it of the foreman. Another was earning L.4 a
week. His master told him he ought to lay by.
"Oh," said he, "I can spend all I make." "But,"
said the master, "what shall you do, if the times
are bad, with your wife and children?" "Let 'em
go to the Union," said he. The master himself
told my friend this. Mr Baker, the Inspector of
Factories, in one of his Reports, stated that a
moulder, his wife, and boy on an average earn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">{643}</a></span>
L.5, 10s. 6d. a week. He mentions a case of a
moulder, his wife, and three children earning
L.8, 7s. 2½d.</p>

<p>'How can we wonder, with such facts as
these before us, that Mr Sandford, Her Majesty's
Inspector, stated in one of his Reports: "Out
of 50 (lads) examined in nine different night
schools, 29, or 58 per cent., could not read. These
night scholars are certainly not the most untaught
of the collier lads. 'There's none of them as can
read in our pit,' I heard two young colliers say;
'no, nor the master neither.' And yet we wonder
that our colliers do not invest their earnings
wisely."'</p>

<p>Loud and prolonged has been the denunciation
of public-houses as the cause of crime and misery&mdash;so
easy is it to mistake secondary for primary
causes. While admitting that public-houses scattered
in profusion are the cause of many evils,
we go a little farther, and looking for what produces
the cause, find that it consists in depraved
tastes, want of self-respect, unthrift. To a man
of elevated tendencies and intelligent foresight,
the number of public-houses is a matter of
no importance. He passes by the whole with
indifference. Their allurements only excite his
pity. He scorns their temptations. It is to this
pitch of fortitude we should like to see the
weak-minded brought, through education and the
habitual cultivation of self-respect, along with
a deep consciousness of responsibilities. In
therefore so exclusively attacking public-houses
as the cause of intemperance, we are in a sense
beginning the process of cure at the wrong end.
We are expending energies on secondary causes,
leaving the seat of the disease untouched. Under
infatuations of this kind, the misdirection of
moral power is pitiable. The subject is wide,
and might be expatiated on to any extent. We
here confine ourselves to the remark, that the
thing to cultivate is Thrift&mdash;not only as regards
the expenditure of money but expenditure of
time, and in saying this we fear that those who
have systematically, though with good intentions,
advocated a degree of recreation that must be
deemed excessive and dangerous, have not a little
to answer for in promoting habits of unthrift.</p>

<h3>PART II.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about this time, or some three or four days
after Kingston's arrival, that Mistress Dinnage
was sitting&mdash;languidly for her&mdash;at the door of the
lodge. Mistress Dinnage lived a life of constant
energy; she did not sit and lament; she had her
sorrows; but they were closed within the proudest
heart that ever beat, and no man knew of them.
But all the more dangerous is the stern sorrow
that feeds upon itself, the aching, ever-present
grief, so stoically disregarded. Mistress Dinnage
indulged in neither tears nor regrets; bravely she
did her duty day by day, and never would sit
down to court a sweet and fancied dream. But
when evening came, what had she to do? Father
was not home; the tall clock in the corner went
tick, tick, tick! Lady Deb was busied with her
kinsman Kingston Fleming; old Marjory was no
companion to Mistress Dinnage. Lives are so
different. In some more genial lives, in some gay
changeful or adventurous life, sorrow and despair
are kept at bay. In contrast to this life of Margaret's,
there was May Warriston far away, dreaming
through courtly galleries, gazing on splendid
pictures, listening to ravishing music, kneeling
before gorgeous shrines. Amid such scenes as
these, the heart-strings may be tuned to never a
discordant note. But in eternal calm, in depressing
sickness, in dreary hours of solitude, <i>then</i> the grim
spectre looks on us face to face. We may work;
ay, but when we pause to rest? Work, everlasting
work, gives a stern sense of satisfaction and the
comfort of 'something done;' but unlightened
by sweeter moments, neither softens the heart nor
strengthens the mind. Under that stern government,
imagination sleeps, thought grows torpid,
the poor wounded soul is grasped within the iron
hand it defies, Nature herself lies bruised and
bleeding.</p>

<p>In the hours of hard work and daylight, sorrow
was to Margaret Dinnage unheeded, unheard, uncared
for; but when forced inaction came, when
the little room darkened slowly, and the lightest
whisper of the breeze began to be heard above the
hushed tumult of the world, then the tall clock
told a monotonous tale moment by moment to the
proud still heart&mdash;a tale of solitude and hopeless
calm. She would go to the porch not to hear it;
but to go out and roam about the happy fields she
could not, for there she had played when a child.
No; better stand at the door and watch; father
would be coming soon.</p>

<p>One evening as Mistress Dinnage thus watched,
the gate swung to; not the stooping form of old
Jordan Dinnage, but a tall and tower-like figure
loomed through the gloaming and darkened the
doorway. Loud and full beat the heart of Mistress
Dinnage; she could not speak. For the first time
for years, she and Charles Fleming were alone.</p>

<p>'Who is at Enderby?' he asked, in a short stern
voice.</p>

<p>'Mistress Deborah,' she answered, with hurried
breathless utterance, 'an' Master Kingston Fleming.'</p>

<p>'Not my father?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Has Master Sinclair been here lately?'</p>

<p>'Yes; he was over yesterday morning.'</p>

<p>Then the gloaming parted as it were to admit of
a blink of sunshine, and the dark eyes that were
gazing up sought the haggard eyes that were gazing
down upon them, and all in a flash. Twilight and
the wild sweet solitude around them drew those
proud hearts together with a power that yearning
nature could not resist. The spell of Love was
woven around them. Not one word was uttered:
stern silence, weary endless longing, pride, grief,
trouble, despair, all were now hushed in one
long embrace. Long and wordless as had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">{644}</a></span>
estrangement, so swift and wordless the wooing;
no syllable was needed to tell what the soul had
known.</p>

<p>What mattered it in that supreme moment that
he was a hunted ruined fugitive&mdash;that she was a
poor and penniless girl&mdash;that they met but to part
again? The sweet summer breeze was blowing
round them; the trees trembled with gladness
overhead; they were young; the world was wide
and free. The solemn warning voice of the old
clock, for them spoke in vain.</p>

<p>When Mistress Dinnage could speak, she whispered
on his breast: 'Thou'rt in trouble.'</p>

<p>'In trouble? Yes.' Then, with a reckless laugh,
he took her face between his hands, and answered
by wild and passionate kisses.</p>

<p>'Nay; thou must speak,' she went on earnestly,
and holding back his head with her little hands.
'Kisses will not aid thee, or I would kiss thee till I
died. Speak, Master Fleming! Art thou ruined?'</p>

<p>'Ay; stick and stone.'</p>

<p>'I saw it in thy face, only now the love-light
covers it. Oh, how canst thou look so glad for my
poor love, when thou'rt ruined and <i>disgraced</i>?
Bethink thee, Master Fleming. Thine old home
will go to strangers. Thy sister will share in thy
disgrace. Thy father will go in sorrow to the
grave. Thou'rt ruined, disgraced, <i>dishonoured</i>!'</p>

<p>He caught her to his heart, and then held her
wildly from him, regarding her with infinite
pathos. '<i>And wilt thou throw me over, Meg?</i>'</p>

<p>Then spoke she anxiously: 'What is it thou
mean'st? Speak out to me. Let there be no
secrets and no riddling. Dost thou love me <i>truly</i>?'</p>

<p>Then answered the proud liquid glance of those
dark eyes; and whispered the youth low in
her ear: 'I would like to kill thee for this
questioning! <i>Truly</i>, love? Dost thou know
Charles Fleming so little, that thou'rt in doubt?
that thou canst believe he could wrong the only
girl he ever loved? Ruffian, gamester, roysterer
though I be, I would keep thee pure as snow&mdash;snowdrift.
Thou shalt make me a better man, who
knows? For thy love I thirst, Meg, and have
thirsted long. Now&mdash;ruined, an outcast, a fugitive,
is the moment I choose to seek thee! Wilt have
me, Meg, for better, for worse? Wilt share the
fortunes of a sinner? Perilous, comfortless, will
be thy lot, love. Wilt thou be my wife?'</p>

<p>She could not speak; she answered by a low cry
of love and joy. What recked Mistress Dinnage
of the proud grand home and the heir of the
Flemings, all passed away! She loved&mdash;with all
the pure abandonment of a woman's love&mdash;this
houseless wanderer.</p>

<p>So came Charlie Fleming, and went, and haunted
in the twilight round Enderby, and no one knew
of it save Mistress Dinnage. She was put about,
dismayed, torn by anxiety by all she heard; and
the two loves of her life, the loves of father and
lover, were wrestling wildly in her soul. Though
fearing for her lover, yet, strange inconsistency,
her step was light as air, her heart was filled with
a new joy, and her eyes with happy tears.</p>

<p class='p2'>'I must go,' thought Kingston Fleming desperately
to himself, the morning after the above
scene. 'The old fellow won't turn up, neither
does Charlie. I mustn't compromise <i>her</i>. But she
must not be alone. I doubt&mdash;I doubt sorely
about the future. Poor sweet child! I will
speak to old Marjory; she must hold that flighty
Mistress Dinnage in the house. And I will get
Deb to send for May Warriston.' So thinking,
Kingston went into the garden, where he saw
Deborah at her flowers, and abruptly he began:
'I am come to say farewell, Deb. Don't look
scared, little coz; you shall not be left alone.'</p>

<p>'Then whom shall I have, King?' she asked,
clinging suddenly to his arm. 'Father is away;
Charlie is away; and I am in hourly fear of evil
tidings. You say, <i>not alone!</i> O King, I shall
be alone indeed!'</p>

<p>'Little one, I am going to write to May Warriston,
to beg her to come and bear you company.
Meantime, I am going to see your father.
I know his whereabouts, love; I will send him
home to-night. And have ye not Marjory, Jordan,
and your beloved Mistress Dinnage?'</p>

<p>'Ay, I have them all. But what are weak
women and a poor old man compared to your
size and strength? With you, King, I am safe.
In your presence I can be thoughtless and glad
again. In your presence&mdash;I am happy.'</p>

<p>'O Deb, Deb! Don't persuade me. I mustn't
stay with you. Ill tongues will be talking of
you and me.'</p>

<p>'What! of brother and sister? Of kinsfolk? It
cannot, cannot be. But let the world talk! What
matters it? Will you, for paltry slander, forsake
me at this strait?'</p>

<p>'Not forsake you, but consider you. Let go my
hand, Deb! I am easily unmanned nowadays.
I must go.'</p>

<p>'Well, go, go!'&mdash;and she pushed him from her.
'And indeed I would have you seek my father,
King, for I am very sad at heart. Cheer him up;
comfort him; wean him from his temptation if
you can. It is that terrible gambling that is the
ruin of the Flemings. Oh, tell him so! But above
all things, send him home, for I have a dark, dark
foreboding on me; and this night alone at Enderby
would drive me mad.'</p>

<p>'He shall come.'</p>

<p>'Then go, King, quickly.'</p>

<p>'You are in a hurry to be rid o' me, now.
Good-bye, sweet Deb; good-bye. You will not
come and see me off?'</p>

<p>'Nay; I cannot.'</p>

<p>'Well, good-bye, Enderby.' Kingston Fleming
bared his head and gazed round, strangely moved,
at the old familiar scene. His keen blue eyes grew
dim. It did not shame his manhood that tears
were drawn like life-blood from his heart, as he
nobly renounced a sore temptation. 'Good-bye,
Enderby; good-bye.'</p>

<p>He was gone. But still Deborah Fleming,
amid her gay and dazzling flowers, seemed to
see him standing there, a tall graceful figure, a
face full of sadness and regret, a bared head
that reverently bowed its adieus; and the words
still rang in her ears: 'Good-bye, Enderby;
good-bye.' Ten short minutes and all life had
changed for her; only when he was gone, she
waked to her despair. The sun had ceased to
shine, the birds had ceased to sing, the flowers
to bloom. She left her gathered flowers to die,
and went home like one stunned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">{645}</a></span></p>


<h4>CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.</h4>

<p>Sir Vincent did return that night; he had
seen Kingston, he said. He was very late, and he
was tired. He asked Deborah if Mistress Dinnage
were with her.</p>

<p>'Yes, dear father. But you are going to sleep
at home?'</p>

<p>'Ay; but I may be off early&mdash;too early for even
thee, my bird of dawn.'</p>

<p>'Nay, father; I will be up, not to see thee off,
but to hold thee here. Thou shalt not go tomorrow!'</p>

<p>He smiled. He looked pale. He kissed her
fondly.</p>

<p>'Lady Wilful, I must. I want to see my boy.
He is ever in trouble.'</p>

<p>'Nay; think not about it to-night, father. King
has promised to find him out.'</p>

<p>And so they parted. Weary-hearted, with all
the brightness called up for her father laid aside,
Deborah sought her chamber, weeping. She recalled,
the night when her father had told her
Kingston Fleming was betrothed, her wild despair.
But she was a child, and the bright morrow had
then brought hope and healing. Now she was a
woman, and a woman's sorrow lay deep within her
breast. Tired out, Deborah undressed and lay
down on her bed, not to wake and weep, but to
sink into a deep dreamless slumber....</p>

<p>With a start she awoke. A start often wakes
us from the soundest sleep, as if some spirit
spoke. Deborah Fleming was so wide awake in a
moment that she saw through her open window
the little pale ghost of the waning moon, the
drifting clouds flitting by. A strange feeling
was on Deborah. Had she been dreaming that she
had seen a light shining under her father's door?
Dream or vision, she seemed to see it still, and was
irresistibly drawn thither by a mysterious inner
sense of alarm. She must go to her father's room,
to see that all was well. With a wildly beating
heart, she threw on her dressing-gown and went
swiftly out. Gray dawn filled all the passages,
a gray cold dawn, and the little birds were beginning
to twitter. But yes&mdash;oh, strange and true, a
light was glimmering under her father's door!</p>

<p>Deborah heard him moving; she knocked.
'Father!'&mdash;No answer.&mdash;'Father!'</p>

<p>'Who is there?'</p>

<p>'Deborah! Father, open your door; I must
speak with you at once.'</p>

<p>She tried the door: it gave way; and Deborah
saw a room scattered over with papers, in the
wildest confusion. The window stood open, and
Sir Vincent, looking gray and haggard in the
uncertain light, stood against the table in the
middle of the room. He was dressed; his long
white hair was ruffled; his face was gray, pale;
his eyes gleamed strangely on Deborah from under
their lowering brows.</p>

<p>'Father!' said Deborah, 'my father!' A great
trembling was on her, he looked at her so strangely;
but she kept outwardly calm. She laid her hands
upon his arm, and then her eyes fell from his
troubled face to his trembling hand, which was
striving vainly to hide something amongst the
papers on the table. Deborah saw the handle of a
pistol; she drew it out, and regarded him steadfastly.
'Father, father! what is this?'</p>



<p>He turned from her; his white head was bowed
with shame in his hands, and she heard a bitter
sob.</p>

<p>'I know it now,' said Deborah, with terrible
calmness. 'God called me here. O dear father,
what have you thought on? To get free of ruin,
you would kill your soul. Kind heaven have
mercy on thee! You would leave me, father; you
would leave me and Charlie.' She flung the pistol
out of the room; she threw her arms round him.
Sobs were shaking the strong man's frame.</p>

<p>'O never think to leave me alone, father dear.
It was sinful of you not to call me; you might
have known your little daughter would sooner
share your death, than wake to find you dead.'</p>

<p>'God forgive me, Deb; God forgive me;' and he
sank into his chair faint, trembling, shuddering.
Deborah, on her knees beside him, scarcely knew
her proud father, he was so unmanned. She
waited in silence, with her head laid down on his
knee. When he could speak, he said: 'I see God's
hand in this; I believe in Him as I never believed
before. Child! nothing less than a miracle
brought thee here, as heaven is my witness; in
another moment, Deb, I should have been a dead
man. I had the pistol in my hand; may He
forgive me, Deb!'</p>

<p>Then Deborah looked up white and calm: 'What
could have induced you, father? What ruin could
be great enow to justify so great a sin? The loss
of house and lands? Let them go. You and I
had better live in some poor honest way, than keep
at Enderby. Let it go. It is no great matter, so
long as you have your children's love.'</p>

<p>He groaned. 'It isn't all, Deb; ruin isn't all.
We have that, and enow. But ye know the
old saying, "Death before dishonour."&mdash;Charlie,
Charlie!' and the father's tremulous lips struggled
piteously to utter more.</p>

<p>'Has Charlie <i>disgraced</i> us then? How, father?'</p>

<p>'God forbid that I tell thee how. My boy has
killed me.'</p>

<p>'Will <i>money</i> save him, father?' The stern low
voice scarcely seemed Deborah Fleming's.</p>

<p>'Money, ay; but we are beggars.'</p>

<p>Deborah started to her feet. 'Well, think of it
no more; you are wearied to death, my father.
Thinking won't right you nor save Charlie. Sleep
in peace, father, for I will save ye both this day.'</p>

<p>He stared in her face. 'Heaven bless thee, Deb.
I know not what thou say'st. I think my brain is
shaken, Deb. But <i>thou'rt</i> my only stay.' With
that, the heart-broken old man, fallen so lowly
from his high estate, lay down, and fell into a deep
sleep. Not so Deborah.</p>

<p>Late in the morning, Sir Vincent awaked, and
called for his daughter. It seemed that she
was near, for he had scarcely called before she
stood beside his bed. His strength was recruited;
the strong and nervous spirit had regained its
power, and lived again in torture. He gazed up at
Deborah, piteous in his grim sorrow; still, in all
his strength, he turned to her: 'Deborah, my
child, what is to be done?'</p>

<p>'I am decided, father. I will be Adam Sinclair's
wife. He has money enow to buy Enderby.
Look you, you have nothing more to say; only
see that he knows he may marry me.'</p>

<p>'Thou'lt marry Adam Sinclair! Deb, art in
earnest? Can ye do this? But does it vex ye,
love? Does it grieve ye <i>too</i> much?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">{646}</a></span></p>

<p>She looked so calm, he could not believe this
sacrifice, but half believed her indifferent; he was
sorely trembling.</p>

<p>'Nay, father. How vexed? how grieved? Ask
me no questions. You know, father, I was
always "Lady Wilful," and very firm. Here
now is a note writ by mine own hand to <i>him</i>.
I am decided.'</p>

<p>Sir Vincent rose up; he knew not if he were
most glad or grieved or scared, as he took her in
his arms and blessed her. Never had Deborah
received love or blessing so passively. She put
the note in his hands, and looking at him with her
great gray earnest eyes: 'Sweet father,' she said,
'it must needs be soon; and that he may know
that I am in earnest, I have left that "soon" to
him. I am sincere with him, father, and I tell him
I have no love to give; but I would fain save
Enderby; and so I ask him if he will save Enderby
for love of me, and yet leave me free. There is
a loophole, father, for I have no wish to wed.
But if he must wed Deborah Fleming, and only
this will move him, I am ready. But as he will
choose the wedding-day, I stipulate for freedom
till that day, never to write nor meet till the
bells ring for the wedding. Let me be Deborah
Fleming till then, and forget Adam Sinclair!
Lovers and wooing I cannot abide. And life is
long enow from the wedding to the grave!'</p>

<p>Sir Vincent stood with the letter in his hand.
'Deborah, ye speak strangely; yet you are smiling,
and your eyes and cheeks are bright. Little one,
tell thy wretched father if thou'rt unhappy over
this? Speak, Deb, darling; and if it grieves thee,
I will see myself in jail, and Charlie on the
gallows, ere thou shalt sacrifice thy life. Deborah,
be honest with me.'</p>

<p>'Why, I am honest always. It will not hurt
<i>me</i>. I will be a good wife to him till the day I die,
if it must needs be so. But would you have me
say I love him, reverence him? This cannot be.
But if he will not save Enderby otherwise, I will
be his wife. Of the rest&mdash;I will not ask you&mdash;I
dare not. But Charlie shall be saved.'</p>

<p>At these words Sir Vincent fell on his knees, and
kissed his child's dress like one beside himself, and
then pale and wordless, rushed away.... Then
Deborah was left <i>alone</i>. The gay sun was shining
in, and the birds were singing from far and near;
away up, Deborah's pet bird the skylark was
pouring out his supreme song of freedom in the
blue fields of space. She heard the trilling
cadence from the wild bird's throat. It drew her
to the window, where she leaned out, and drank in
those delirious strains of joy, and stretched out her
arms to the blue sky, and thought of the little
nest where the bird would drop, when tired
with wandering and with song. Could she be
Deborah Fleming? Would the messenger now
speeding to Lincoln Castle bring her back freedom,
or death in life? She must wait, she must
wait! Meantime, the o'ercome was ringing in
her ears of an old song that Kingston Fleming
whistled when a boy, and the sweet warm sun
was shining on her, and Deborah laid her aching
head and her arms down on the window-sill and
fell fast asleep. It was then that Mistress Dinnage
stole in; her face too was pale and grave, but not
so pale as the sleeping one over which she leaned.
With her hands clasped, she stood regarding it till
her lips quivered, and tears of troubled anxiety
started to her eyes. 'Ay,' she said with stern
tenderness, 'you will die for him yet; but <i>I</i> would
die for <i>him</i> and <i>you</i>.' Then softly and in tender
care, young Mistress Dinnage passed a soft cushion
under the little head, and laid a light shawl over
Deborah to shield her from the sun, and stole
away.</p>

<h2><a name="MARKET-GARDEN_WOMEN" id="MARKET-GARDEN_WOMEN">MARKET-GARDEN WOMEN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the fruit-harvest is in progress, travellers
through the western outskirts of London will
doubtless have noticed the numerous gangs of
women employed in gathering and packing fruit and
vegetables for market; the railway in that district
running for several miles through market-gardens
and orchards. The peculiar dress of these women&mdash;consisting
of a large calico sun-bonnet, brightly
coloured neckerchief, short skirts reaching scarcely
below the knee, and large holland aprons&mdash;is alone
sufficient to attract attention, even in the momentary
glimpse one obtains of them as the train
sweeps past. Daily, in sunshine and rain, these
women are busy collecting the fruit and vegetables
which are nightly conveyed to the London markets;
and as some knowledge of their manner of life and
the amount of their earnings may prove interesting,
we offer to our readers the substance of a conversation
held with a member of one of the gangs
during the earlier part of the season.</p>

<p>'Do we get pretty good wages? Well, you see,
sir, it all depends on the season. Just now, when
strawberries are in and peas, we can earn as much
as thirty shillings a week&mdash;some weeks more.
Raspberries and beans we do pretty well with, but
gooseberries and currants ain't so good: eight-and-twenty
shillings a week is as much as we can make
at those, working hard and long for that. Of
course we have to work long hours, beginning at
four or five o'clock in the morning, and keeping at
it till eight and sometimes later at night, generally
taking about an hour's rest at dinner-time. But as
we gather all the fruit by piece-work, and so to
speak, our time is our own, what dinner-time we
take depends on what sort of a morning's work
we've made&mdash;sometimes longer and sometimes
shorter. You see, this is how we work. In my
gang there's six of us, that have always worked
together for a good many years now. We get one
on each side of a row of strawberries or raspberries
or peas, or what not; and when one basket is full,
we puts a few handfuls in our apron, always
managing so as to take in all the baskets full
together; and then at night, when our work is
counted up, we share it equally amongst us. We
always know every night how much we have made,
but only get paid once a week, on Saturdays:
Saturday, you know, being an easy day with us,
on account of there being no market on Sunday.
Our missis is very good that way: every Saturday,
afore twelve o'clock, there is our money, much or
little; though there is some of the masters as think
nothing of keeping their women waiting about till
six or seven o'clock at night before they pay them,
and perhaps then only gives 'em a part of it; which
comes hard on folks as live from hand to mouth, as
we have to do; the shop at which we deal only
giving one week's credit&mdash;pay up one Saturday
night, and run on as much as you like till the next;
or if you don't pay up, no more credit till you
does.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">{647}</a></span></p>

<p>'Apples and pears and such-like fruit we have
nothing to do with&mdash;men gather <i>them</i> in. In fact
as often as not the master sells the fruit as it stands
on the tree, and the buyer has to get his own men
to pluck it. But there's always some sort of fruit
or vegetables to be gathered from the beginning of
spring till the end of summer as we can do by
piecework; and then the potatoes come in, which
we pick up after they've been turned out of the
ground by men or by a machine; but that we does
by day-work, getting one-and-sixpence a day when
we work from six to six; and one-and-twopence
when we work from eight till dark. In winter-time
there's always something to be done dibbing in
cabbage-plants, weeding, and such-like; but what
with sharp frosts and heavy snows, we don't earn
much then, perhaps doing three or four days' work
in a week. Of course if we haven't had the sense to
put by some of the money we make in the good
times of summer, times come cruel hard on us in
the winter; and very few of us like to apply to the
parish if we can anyhow help it. Not but what
our missis is good to us in that way, often finding
us a day's work when it ain't needed, and always
giving us a half-pint of beer at the end of the day;
which we can't claim, you know.</p>

<p>'We don't take much count of rain either winter
or summer, because, you see, people will have their
fruit and vegetables fresh gathered; and so we
wrap ourselves well up and make the best of it.
As I said before, Saturday we don't do much; but
then we have to make up for it on Sundays, so as
to send the fruit fresh to Monday's market.</p>

<p>'Don't we suffer from rheumatics? Well, you
mightn't think so, but it ain't often any of us ails
much. You see, being out in all weathers, we get
hardened to it; and besides, we always take good
care to keep our feet warm and dry&mdash;that's why
we wear such heavy boots; and that's the chief
thing to look after, if you don't want to catch cold;
so people say. There ain't many of us but what is
on the wrong side of thirty; four out of <i>my</i> gang
being widows this many a year, with grown-up
sons and daughters; and it's the same in most
gangs. Sometimes we have young women amongst
us; but there's not many of 'em stays at it after
they are married; not all the year through, I mean;
perhaps coming for a day or two at the busiest
times; but even then it hardly pays them, if they
have a young family about 'em. The gangs of
young women as you sometimes see, we don't
count as belonging to us; they only coming up
from Shropshire mostly&mdash;for a month or six weeks
at the busiest part of the season. Children we
never have working with us, I suppose because they
wouldn't be careful enough about not crushing
the fruit; which as <i>you</i> know, it would never pay
to send crushed fruit into market. For my part,
I'm very glad as there is no children allowed
amongst us, as though it ain't very hard work,
it's terribly tedious and back-aching. When our
children is old enough, we send the girls out to
service somewhere; and there's always plenty of
work for the lads, of some sort, about the farms;
which is a good deal better than breaking their
backs at <i>our</i> work.</p>

<p>'We all of us in my gang live hereabouts, in
those little cottages that you see yonder. Three
shillings a week the rent of 'em is; but then
there's a good piece of garden-ground at the back;
and most of us has lodgers, young men what work
on the farms and in the gardens mostly. Four
rooms there is in my cottage; and I have three
lodgers, sometimes four, two sleeping in one room.
Good lads they are too. You see, as they get
home before I do, I always lay my fire in the
morning before I go out; and a neighbour of mine
sets it alight in time for the kettle to be a-boiling
when they come in to their tea at six o'clock; and
they never misses leaving a potful of good strong
tea for me to have when I get home; which you
may be sure is all the more grateful through
being the only hot drink I get all day, having only
a drop of cold tea, which I carry in that can there,
for my breakfast. And maybe if we are working
near a public-house, we club up, and one of us goes
and gets a drop of beer to drink with our dinners.</p>

<p>'If it wasn't for the lodgers, the gardens wouldn't
be much use to us; but they generally take it in
hand, and often comes to take a pride in it; so that
we are never short of such vegetables as are in
season; which helps a good way towards the rent.
They also chop up my wood and fetch my water
for me, and make themselves handy in a score of
ways; indeed if I lost my lodgers, I don't know
what I should do. It ain't much cooking I do in
the week; but what there is to do I do after I
come home. On Sunday the lads always look for
a hot dinner; which when I'm at home, I cook for
them; and when I'm at work I get all ready on
Saturday night, and one of 'em takes it to the
bakehouse to be baked. When we do work on
Sundays, if we anyhow can manage it, we try to
get done by three or four o'clock, so as we may be
in time to dress and go to church; which as a rule
we mostly do.</p>

<p>'I can't read nor yet write, and I don't suppose
as there's a-many amongst the oldest of us as can.
It wasn't much chance of schooling girls like us
got in my time, as we was sent out to work at
something or other when we was about nine or
ten. I did go to school for a little while; but if I
learnt anything I must have forgotten it again.
The young ones are better off for the matter of
that, and are always willing to read or write a
letter for us when we want 'em.</p>

<p>'Nineteen years I've been at it regular now,
sir; and though I was left a widow with seven
children, the oldest of 'em only ten and one at the
breast, I'm proud and thankful to say as we've
never had any need to ask once for a loaf of bread
even from the parish, and trust as we never shall. I
ain't the only one either, for there's Mrs Amblin as
lives next door to me was left with nine children,
oldest only twelve, and has lived to see 'em all
doing for themselves without being beholden to
nobody for a crust of bread. Some years, when
the fruit has been backward or scarce, we've had a
very close push to make ends meet; but it has only
taught us to be more careful when we have a good
season, and to put by a little more towards a bad
one. We don't use any bank, bless you! what
little we can manage to put by, we generally likes
to have handy where we can put our hand on it
when we want it. Of course, there's no telling
what may happen; but while I have my health
and strength left me, I shall always be able to earn
as much as I need; and if it should happen as <i>they</i>
fail me, well, what with lodgers and the shilling
or two my children will help me with, I daresay I
shall struggle along somehow. Mostly, though our
children don't come to be much more than field-hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">{648}</a></span>
and farm-labourers, when the time comes
they don't begrudge what is due to their parents,
and manage somehow to keep 'em out of the workhouse.
Not but some of 'em goes to the bad, as
might be expected, seeing the little schooling we
can afford to give them, and the temptations there
is for them nowadays; but it is only here and
there one, and they generally finish up by listing
for a soldier, which soon steadies 'em. One of my
lads is away now in the East Indies; and though I
don't often hear from him, he seems to be getting
on quite as well as ever he'd ha' done at home.
Our girls mostly gets acquainted with one or other
of the men working about the place where they
are at service, and get married, sooner perhaps
than what we old folks think they ought to&mdash;about
nineteen or twenty&mdash;and settle down near
where their husbands work.</p>

<p>'We don't get much chance of holidays when
once the season begins, until it is over; because,
you see, sir, the master must keep the market
supplied; and if he finds one of us not to be
depended on to do our work every day, he very
soon gets somebody in her place that is; which
perhaps is one reason why young women never
care to settle down to our life. Altogether, our
work ain't so very hard; and if we do have to keep
at it for a many hours at a stretch, it's all in the
open air, which is a good deal better than being
shut up in the walls of a factory; and if we are
anyways steady and careful, we can always make
sure of a pretty good living. So that you see, sir,
there's many as is worse off than us poor garden-women.'</p>

<h2><a name="SEA-SPOIL" id="SEA-SPOIL">SEA-SPOIL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Somewhat</span> more than a year ago, we called attention
to the changes which are to be perceived in
the relations of land and water; the action of
rivers on the land, and the influence of delta-lands
in restoring land, to the earth, being noted in the
article alluded to; whilst the destructive action
of the sea on many points of the coast was also
detailed. In the present instance we purpose to
examine a few of the more typical cases of sea-action
viewed in its destructive effect upon the
land, and also some aspects of earth-movements
which undoubtedly favour the destructive power
of the ocean.</p>

<p>As regards these destructive powers, much depends
of course on the nature of the rock-formations
which lie next the sea. A hard formation will,
<i>cæteris paribus</i>, resist the attack of the waves to a
greater extent than a deposit of soft nature; and the
varying nature of the coast-lines of a country determines
to a very great extent the regularity or irregularity
of the sea's action. A well-known example
of a case in which the ocean has acquired over the
land an immense advantage in respect of the softness
of the formations which favoured its inroad, is
found on the Kentish coast. Visitors to Margate
and Ramsgate, or voyagers around the south-east
corner of our island, know the ancient church of
Reculver&mdash;or the 'Reculvers' as it is now named&mdash;as
a familiar landmark. Its two weather-beaten
towers and the dismantled edifice are the best
known objects amongst the views of the Kentish
coast; and to both geologist and antiquary the
'Reculvers' present an object of engrossing interest.
In the reign of Henry VIII. the church was one
mile distant from the sea; and even in 1781 a very
considerable space of ground intervened between
the church and the coast-line&mdash;so considerable
indeed, that several houses and a churchyard of
tolerable size existed thereupon. In 1834 the sea
had made such progress in the work of spoliation,
that the intervening ground had disappeared, and
the 'Reculvers' appeared to exist on the verge at
once of the cliff and of destruction. An artificial
breakwater has, however, saved the structure; but
the sacred edifice has been dismantled, and its
towers used as marine watch-houses. The surrounding
strata are of singularly soft nature, and
hence the rapidity with which the eroding action
of the waves has proceeded.</p>

<p>An equally instructive case of the destructive
action of the sea is afforded by the history of the
parish of Eccles in the county of Norfolk. Prior
to the accession of James VI. to the English
crown the parish was a fairly populous one. At
that date, however, the inhabitants petitioned the
king for a reduction of taxes, basing their request
on the ground that more than three hundred acres
of their land had been swept away by the sea.
The king's reply was short but characteristic. He
dismissed the petition with the remark, that the
people of Eccles should be thankful that the
sea had been so merciful. Since the time of the
niggardly sovereign just mentioned, Eccles has not
been spared by the sea. Acres upon acres have
been swallowed up by the insatiable waves, and
as Sir Charles Lyell informs us, hills of blown
sand&mdash;forming the characteristic <i>sand-dunes</i> of the
geologist&mdash;occupy the place where the houses of
King James's petitioners were situated. The spire
of the parish church, in one drawing, is indeed
depicted as projecting from amongst the surrounding
sand-dunes, which the wind, as if in league
with the ocean, has blown in upon this luckless
coast.</p>

<p>The comparison of old maps of counties bordering
on the sea with modern charts, affords a striking
and clear idea of the rate and extent of this
work of destruction. No better illustration can be
cited of the ravages of the ocean than that exhibited
in maps of the Yorkshire coast-lines, and
particularly in the district lying between Flamborough
Head and the mouth of the Humber.
Whilst the district between the Wash in Lincolnshire
and the estuary of the Thames shews an
equally great amount of destructive change. Three
feet per annum is said to be no uncommon rate for
soft strata in these localities to be carried away;
and the geologist may point to the famous Goodwin
Sands&mdash;notorious alike in ancient and modern
history&mdash;as another example of the results of sea-action,
and of the wear and tear exercised by the
mighty deep. The contemplation of such actions
fits us in a singularly apt manner for the realisation
of the full force and meaning of the Laureate's
words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There rolls the deep where grew the tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Earth, what changes hast thou seen!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is highly important, however, to note that
the sea receives aid of no ordinary kind in its acts
of spoliation by the operation of certain forces
affecting the land itself. Land frequently disappears
from sight beneath the surface of the sea
by a process of subsidence or sinking. We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">{649}</a></span>
therefore clearly distinguish between the land
which the sea literally takes by its own act, and
that which becomes its property through this
curious subsidence and sinking of the earth's crust.
No doubt the result is practically the same in each
case; the sea being in either instance the gainer,
and the land the loser. But the sinking of land
being a phenomenon less familiar to the ordinary
reader, we venture to note a few of its more prominent
aspects.</p>

<p>A primary consideration to which it is needful to
direct attention consists in the due appreciation of
the fact that the land and not the sea is to be here
credited with the action under discussion. When
a considerable part of a coast-line formerly existing
above tide-marks is found to gradually sink below
the sea-level, the observer is probably apt to assume
that the sea has simply altered its level.
The idea of the sea being a constantly changing
body is so widely entertained, and that of the
land being a solid and immovable portion of the
constitution of the earth, is also so deeply rooted
in the popular mind, that it may take some little
thinking to throw on the land the burden of the
change and alteration. It is nevertheless a fact
that the great body of water we name the ocean
in reality obeys the laws we see exemplified in
the disposition of the water contained in a cup or
bowl. The water of the sea thus maintains the
same level, and is no more subject to violent and
permanent alterations than is the water in the cup
or bowl. Hence when part of a coast-line appears
to become submerged, we must credit the land with
being the seat of the change, seeing that the sea
must be regarded as stable, unless indeed it could
be shewn that the level of the sea had undergone
a similar change on all the coasts it touches.
Thus if the southern coast of England were found
to have been depressed say to the extent of six
feet, we must credit the land with the change,
unless we could shew that the sea-level on the
opposite or French coast had also changed. Now
the alterations of land are mostly local or confined
to limited areas, and are not seen in other lands
bounded by the same sea or ocean as the altered
portion. Hence that the land must be regarded as
the unstable and the sea as the stable element, has
come to be regarded as a fundamental axiom of
geology.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the works of man&mdash;such as
piers, harbours, and dwellings&mdash;become the spoil
of the sea, the action has either been one effected
by the force of the waves without any change of
level of the land, or one in which land has simply
subsided independently of the destructive action
of the sea. In the extreme south of Sweden this
action of land-subsidence is at present proceeding
at a rate which has been determined by observations
conducted for the past century and a half or
more. The lower streets of many Swedish sea-port
towns have thus been under water for many
years, and even streets originally situated far
above the water-level have been rendered up as
prey to the sea by this mysterious sinking of
land. Linnæus (as on a former occasion we
remarked) in 1749 marked the exact site and position
of a certain stone. In 1836 this stone was
found to be nearer the water's edge by one hundred
feet than when the great naturalist had observed
it; the subsidence having proceeded at this rate
and degree in eighty-seven years. The earliest
Moravian missionaries in Greenland had frequently
to shift the position of the poles to which they
moored their boats, owing to the subsidence of
land carrying their poles seawards, as it were, by
the inflow of the sea over what was once dry land.
On the coasts of Devon and Cornwall the observer
may detect numerous stumps of trees&mdash;still fixed
by their roots in the soil in which they grew&mdash;existing
under water; the site being that of an old
forest which was submerged by the sinking of the
land, and which has become converted into the
spoil and possession of the sea. Even the long
arm of the sea&mdash;the 'loch' of the Scotch and the
'fjord' of Norway&mdash;which seen in the outline of a
map, or in all its natural beauty, imparts a character
of its own to the scenery of a country, exists
to the eye of the geologist simply as a submerged
valley, whose sides were once 'with verdure
clad,' and on whose fertile slopes trees grew
in luxuriant plenty. The subsidence of the land
has simply permitted its place to be occupied by
water, and the vessel may sail for miles over
what was once a fertile valley.</p>

<p>Occasionally the fluctuations of land may be
exemplified to an extent which could hardly be
expected, a fact well illustrated by the case of the
Temple of Jupiter Serapis at Puzzuoli on the Bay
of Naples. This temple, now in ruins, dates from
a very ancient period, three marble pillars remaining
to mark the extent of what was once a
magnificent pile of buildings. Half-way up these
pillars the marks of boring shell-fish are seen;
some burrows formed by these molluscs still containing
the shells by means of which they were
excavated. At the present time, the sea-level is
at the very base of the pillars, or exists even below
that site. Hence arises the natural question&mdash;'How
did the shell-fish gain access to the pillars,
to burrow into them in the manner described?'
Dismissing as an irrelevant and impossible idea
that of the molluscs being able to ascend the dry
pillars, two suppositions remain. Either the pillars
and temple must have gone down to the sea
through the subsidence of the land, or the sea
must have come up to the pillars. If the latter
theory be entertained, the sea-level must be regarded
as having of necessity altered its level all
along the Bay of Naples and along all the Mediterranean
coasts. And as this inundation would
have occurred within the historic period, we would
expect not only to have had some record preserved
to us of the calamity, but we should also have been
able to point to distinct and ineffaceable traces of
sea-action on the adjoining coasts. There is, however,
no basis whatever for this supposition. No
evidence is forthcoming that any such rise of the
sea ever took place; and hence we are forced to
conclude that the subsidence or sinking of the
land contains the only rational explanation of the
phenomena. We had thus a local sinking of land
taking place at Puzzuoli. The old temple was
gradually submerged; its pillars were buried
beneath the waters of the sea, and the boring
molluscs of the adjacent sea-bed fixed on the
pillars as a habitation, and bored their way into
the stone. Then a second geological change supervened.
The action of subsidence was exchanged
for one of elevation; and the temple and its
pillars gradually arose from the sea, and attained
their present level; whilst the stone-boring shell-fish
were left to die in their homes. The surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">{650}</a></span>
neighbourhood&mdash;that of Vesuvius&mdash;is the scene
of constant change and alteration in land-level;
and the incident is worth recording, if only to
shew how the observation of the apparently
trifling labours of shell-fish serves to substantiate
a grave and important chapter in the history of the
earth.</p>

<p>The statistics of wrecks and of the amount of
human property which have fallen a prey to the
'sounding main' may thus be shewn to be not
only paralleled but vastly exceeded in importance
and extent by the records of the geologist, when he
endeavours to compute the losses of the land or
the gains of the sea. But on the other hand, the
man of science asks us to reflect on the fact that
the matter stolen from us by the sea is undergoing
a process of redistribution and reconstruction. The
fair acres of which we have been despoiled, will
make their appearance in some other form and
fashion as the land of the future; just indeed as the
present land represents the consolidated sea-spoil
of the past, which by a process of elevation has
been raised from the sea-depths to constitute the
existing order of the earth. Waste and repair are
simply the two sides of the geological medal, and
exist at the poles of a circle of ceaseless natural
change. So that, if it be true that the sea reigns
where the land once rose in all its majesty, as
the Laureate has told us, no less certain is it
that&mdash;to conclude with his lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There where the long street roars, hath been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stillness of the central sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus the subject of sea-spoil, like many another
scientific study, opens up before us a veritable
chapter of romance, which should possess the
greater charm and interest, because it is so true.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;LAURA BROUGHT TO TASK.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Admiral says 'good-night' to the last of
his guests; then he turns to his daughter, who is
evidently preparing for a speedy retreat.</p>

<p>'Don't run away yet, Laura; we keep early
hours at Government House, but it is not very
late yet.'</p>

<p>Rather reluctantly, Mrs Best obeys. She knows
perfectly well why her father wishes her to remain,
and she shrewdly suspects what subject of
conversation he is likely to introduce. Now that
she has had her triumph, by carrying out a
pet plan with regard to Katie, that very success
makes her uneasy, for she knows she will be called
to account. However, she resolves to be brave,
and at once leads the way to the music-room. The
servants have already put out most of the lights,
but here the wax-candles are throwing lustre
over scattered music and deserted seats. Laura
gathers up some of the songs, wondering when her
father will begin, and how the attack will open.
She knows it is coming, for he is restlessly pacing
to and fro the room with that quarter-deck march
of his, that betokens an uneasy mind.</p>

<p>'Why were the Greys not here this evening,
Laura?'</p>

<p>She smooths out the leaves of an Italian duet,
lays it on the music-stand, and replies with apparent
indifference: 'Because they were not invited,
papa.'</p>

<p>'Why not? I gave you the list, and I'm certain
their names were down. Why did you omit
them?'</p>

<p>'Is it always necessary to invite the same people
over and over again? The Greys have been at
every party that has taken place since I came here
to stay.'</p>

<p>'Had you any <i>particular</i> reason for leaving
them out, Laura?' asks the Admiral, turning
round quickly, as he notes his daughter's slightly
scornful tone of voice.</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs Best is undecided. Perhaps
a slight meaningless excuse will do. But only
for a passing second does she think thus. Her
frank loyal nature asserts itself, and she says in
a quick earnest manner, with her eyes a little
lowered, her cheeks a little flushed: 'I had a
good reason, papa. Kate Grey makes herself far
too much at home here. One would imagine she
has some special privilege in this house.'</p>

<p>'Well, and I am always glad to see her.'</p>

<p>'She knows that, and presumes on the knowledge.
People seeing her so much at home at
Government House, are beginning to talk in a
most unpleasant manner.'</p>

<p>'What do they say, Laura?'</p>

<p>'They say you mean to make her your second
wife. O papa, surely, <i>surely</i> you will never do
that! A girl so selfish, so ambitious, so fond of
admiration, so, so'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Stop, Laura! The category of faults you lay
to poor Katie's charge is surely long enough. So
people say I mean to make her my second wife,
do they?'</p>

<p>A flush passes over the Admiral's face, and
mounts to his brow. A quick throb rises at his
heart, as for the first time he hears Katie's name
coupled with his own. Till this moment, his
thoughts about her have been vague and unsettled.
He admires her very much&mdash;more than any other
lady he knows; but the idea of making her an
offer of marriage has never seriously entered his
head. But now, his daughter's very cautions, her
very reports of the world's gossip, shadow forth to
him that a marriage between him and Miss Grey
may not be so very preposterous after all, not
such utter madness as he himself would have
called it a few months ago.</p>

<p>Laura, seated on a music-stool, her hands clasped
before her, and her eyes fixed on her father's face,
reads its meaning at once; and as a brave, a loving,
and a fearless daughter, she will not shrink from
the duty she believes is required of her now.
'Dear papa,' she exclaims, 'let me entreat you
not to risk your future happiness! Kate Grey
would never make you a good wife. She cares far
too much for herself ever to study the true
interests of any other person.'</p>

<p>'Why are you so bitter against Miss Grey?'</p>

<p>'I am not bitter. I only tell the real sad truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">{651}</a></span>
Don't let her come to rule in your house; don't
let her rob me of my father's love.'</p>

<p>Sir Herbert draws near his daughter, and looks
tenderly down at her flushed face and moistened
eyes. 'Be reasonable, my child! No one can
ever rob you of my love; but' (here he pauses,
as though hesitating how to word his meaning&mdash;adding
composedly enough) 'should I ever
marry Miss Grey or any other lady, you must
not be prejudiced against my choice, Laura. My
marriage can never injure you in the least.
Remember, your poor mother's fortune was all
settled on you before you married Robert Best.'</p>

<p>'I am not thinking of money, papa. Mere
money considerations do not influence me in the
least.'</p>

<p>'Possibly not. But let me allude to the subject
once more while we are talking. Robert has left
you mistress of his fine estate. You have duties
and responsibilities that separate you almost
entirely from me now. Is not that the case?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I wish I could be more with you.'</p>

<p>'You cannot, Laura, without neglecting your
own interests. Therefore I am at times lonely&mdash;very
lonely in the midst of surrounding society
and occupation. My house needs a head. My
heart yearns sometimes for congenial companionship.
Don't grudge me happiness, Laura, if I can
see my way towards gaining it.'</p>

<p>'I hope and pray every possible happiness may
be yours, papa; but don't look to Katie Grey for
such a thing. She would marry any one to obtain
position and wealth.'</p>

<p>Sir Herbert turns away, and walks to the end
of the room; but he soon comes back again, and
sees his daughter watching him with eyes that are
misty and tearful.</p>

<p>'I am thinking of my own precious mother.
Oh, how different she was from this girl! Miss
Grey is all unworthy to take her place.'</p>

<p>In her earnestness, Mrs Best has risen from the
music-stool, and stands before her father with
great tears coursing down her cheeks. She raises
her clasped hands to him in the most imploring
of all attitudes. The snowy crispy dress with its
white folds gives her a shadowy, almost ghost-like
look; and as her pathetic entreating face turns to
the Admiral, it almost seems to him as though the
soul of her mother is appealing to him through
Laura's eyes. Never has the likeness struck him
so much. It is as though his beloved Bess had
come from the grave to bid him beware.</p>

<p>The daughter sees the impression she has made,
and like many another, presumes too much on her
success, and goes a step too far. Had she stopped
at this point, perhaps her father would have
given her the promise she requires, that he will
not marry Kate Grey. But Laura wipes away
her tears, and exclaims: 'You are coming round
to my views, papa! You are beginning to see how
unfit this Katie is to be your wife. Miss Grimshaw
quite agrees with me about her true character.'</p>

<p>Sir Herbert steps back&mdash;draws himself up to his
full height. 'And what in the world does Miss
Grimshaw know about the matter?'</p>

<p>'She has great powers of discernment. Indeed
it was she who first raised my suspicions, and set
me to watch Katie's man&#339;uvres.'</p>



<p>'Very kind of her! I ought to be particularly
grateful for her surveillance!'</p>

<p>A cloud gathers on the Admiral's brow; but
Laura, unwarned, goes on: 'Adelaide Grimshaw is
<i>all</i> kindness. O papa, I wish you would fix on
<i>her</i>! She would fill the position of mistress to
your household with tact and taste, and would
make you an excellent wife.'</p>

<p>'Thank you for your suggestion, Laura; but be
assured if ever I do marry, Miss Grimshaw will
not be my choice.'</p>

<p>He shudders as memory recalls to his mind
the lank figure of the very elderly lady his
daughter commends to his notice. He recalls the
faded face, the thin wiry curls, the lymphatic eyes,
the bleating plausible voice, with which, in the
calmest manner, she is wont to gossip over the
frailties of her neighbours, and pass hard judgments
on those who are younger and more attractive
than herself. Then his thoughts revert to
Katherine Grey. Whatever her faults may be,
fortunately they are all the very opposite of Miss
Grimshaw's: mind and body are altogether formed
in a very different mould. After this, the conversation
comes to a close, and father and daughter
separate&mdash;she to lament over the Admiral's infatuation;
he to wander for an hour or two more through
the dimly lighted empty suite of rooms.</p>

<p>Laura's words have moved him strangely. His
pulse quickens as he remembers that what has
been to him a half-formed purpose, a whispered
secret, is already the town's talk, and that everybody
is watching to see what will come next.</p>

<p>Has Katie herself heard of these reports, and
begun to trace out the shadow of possible coming
events? Would she be very much surprised if he
tried to give these airy rumours a solid foundation?</p>

<p>Such is the train of thought which floats through
Sir Herbert's mind long after the great house is
closed for the night, and left apparently to sleep
and silence. He hears the measured tramp of the
sentry on the cold damp pavement outside; the
distant sound of the ships' bells in the harbour, as
it is borne in by the wintry blast; and the musical
peals from the church steeples that chime the small
morning hours; but the question still rings its
changes in his mind and finds no satisfactory
answer.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.&mdash;THE QUESTION ANSWERED.</h3>

<p>The next morning Katie takes up her position
at her father's writing-table. She has a letter to
answer&mdash;a very confidential one from her friend
and confidant, Liddy Delmere&mdash;and she feels
bound to return confidence for confidence. Ere
the epistle is finished, she starts up and thrusts
it into her desk. Her eyes have been constantly
wandering from the paper to the cold
slippery streets, where people are jostling against
each other as they make their way through the
showers of falling sleet and gusts of rough wind.
Surely no one would venture out except in a case
of absolute necessity; yet the girl evidently expects
<i>some one</i>; and by the rapid closing of her
desk, no doubt the 'somebody' is in sight.</p>

<p>A tall upright figure may be observed emerging
from the crowds of passers-by; an officer, by the
gold buttons on his rough outside coat. Guiding
his umbrella skilfully, Sir Herbert walks quickly
on, and soon Katie hears his well-known knock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">{652}</a></span>
at the door, and his well-known step in the hall,
as he takes his way to her father's library downstairs.</p>

<p>'He will come up here presently with some
apology to me, or I'm much mistaken,' muses
Kate, as she takes a swift look at herself in the
glass; and ere long the door is thrown open, and
Sir Herbert Dillworth announced. He glances
quickly round the room, and this is what he sees:
a pretty, well-harmonised interior, a blending of
soft warm colours, and a blazing fire in the grate,
that reflects itself in the polished steel surrounding
it. And Kate Grey, the brightest point of the
whole scene, is sitting beside the writing-table,
and looking up with a smile to greet him. She
wears a morning dress of ruby Cashmere, and a
single knot of the same colour in the thick rolls of
her dark hair. There is not a shadow of resentment
in those lustrous eyes as she holds out
her hand, frankly and pleasantly, to her visitor.
Feeling perfectly self-possessed herself, she owns
to a degree of satisfaction as she notices how
disturbed Sir Herbert looks. The fact is his
daughter's words are still ringing in his memory&mdash;'People
say you mean to make her your second
wife'&mdash;and he is wondering what Katie herself
would say on such a subject. Will she ignore the
dreary barrier of years that lies between them?
Will she forget that he has gone some distance
farther on in life's journey, while she is in the
very prime and flush of girlhood? These thoughts
flash through his mind, and make him appear
nervous and absent as he begins to talk about last
night's party. But his mind is made up.</p>

<p>'We missed <i>you</i>, Miss Grey. Will you pardon
us that you had no invitation? My daughter is
not much accustomed to sending them out.'</p>

<p>'Please, don't mention it, Sir Herbert. I am
very glad to go to Government House when I'm
wanted there; but one cannot always be invited,
you know.'</p>

<p>'But I like you always to come. The omission
shall not happen again. We had a wretchedly
stupid gathering. Spare me similar disappointments
in future, Miss Grey, by&mdash;by taking the right of
arranging these matters into your own hands.'</p>

<p>The girl looks up inquiringly. Nothing can be
more unsuspecting and guileless than the questioning
eyes that meet Sir Herbert's.</p>

<p>'Will you <i>take</i> the right, Katie? My life has
grown strangely desolate and lonely of late; will
you cheer it with your presence? In short, will
you be my wife?'</p>

<p>The question is asked now, eagerly and impassion'dly,
and Miss Grey's eyes droop under the
Admiral's gaze. This vision has been dazzling her
mind so long; she has dreamt of it, thought of it;
and now the offer of marriage has really come!
Though the triumph is making her heart throb,
she can hardly tell whether she is glad or
sorry. But she does not draw back. For the
treasure of Sir Herbert's loyal affection, for his
true earnest love, she will give in exchange her
youth and beauty. She thinks the bargain a fair
one, and wonders can anything more be required.</p>

<p>When Sir Herbert leaves his affianced wife, he
goes down to her father, to tell him of what he
calls his 'good fortune.'</p>

<p>'Yes; and mamma and Helen shall hear all
about it from me. Won't they be surprised!' adds
the young lady with a short low laugh, as the
Admiral goes out of the room. She hears him
close the library door, and then says to herself
with another little spasmodic laugh: 'Every one
will be surprised, as I am myself, to think how
quickly it has all come about. Last evening I was
excluded from Government House, and now I
have promised to rule and reign there. Which
has conquered&mdash;Laura Best or I?'</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;FAMILY COUNSEL.</h3>

<p>Mr Grey's library is a curious little room, fitted
up quite in his own way. Maps cover the sides
of the walls, and a large bookcase holds the
books, which are mostly nautical. Models of ships
and steamers are on various shelves, there is an
astrolabe near the window, and a sextant and
some pattern guns on the table. Mr Grey is busy
at the moment with official papers; his nimble
fingers are copying a 'General Memo.' with wonderful
rapidity. Hearing the stately step of his
chief coming along the passage, he naturally supposes
the Admiral has returned to give further
directions about some orders ere long to be
circulated amongst the ships. So he glances up
over his spectacles pen in hand. Great is his
surprise at seeing evident signs of agitation in
Sir Herbert's face, as he says in a low tone: 'Put
aside your papers for an instant, Grey. I want to
consult you on quite another subject. I have come
to ask your consent to my marriage with your
daughter Katie.'</p>

<p>'Your marriage with my daughter, Sir Herbert!'
and Mr Grey lets a huge drop of ink splash on
his 'General Memo.' in his surprise.</p>

<p>'You seem astonished, Grey. Have you any
objection to accept me as your son-in-law?'</p>

<p>'Pardon me, Sir Herbert, pardon my hesitation;
but you startled me for the moment. I am conscious
of the honour you are doing us; but have
you considered how young and inexperienced
Katie is? A mere girl, in fact. She is but little
used to the ways of the world; hardly wise
enough to hold the high position you offer her.'</p>

<p>The Admiral smiles. 'I will take the risk of all
that. Katie is willing, and I am ready to marry
her just as she is.'</p>

<p>'Then I give my full sanction.'</p>

<p>'Wish me joy, Grey. You don't say a word
about that.'</p>

<p>'I will wish you something better and deeper
than mere joy, Sir Herbert. I pray you may
have true and unmixed happiness with my
daughter. May she prove a wife worthy of you,
and may you never regret your choice.'</p>

<p>There is a tremble in Mr Grey's voice as he
grasps the Admiral's hand and ratifies the new
bond sprung up so suddenly between them; and
he looks thoughtfully after Sir Herbert as he
leaves the room. Surely women are fickle, and
his daughter Katie the most fickle of her sex!</p>

<p>Only two months ago, Walter Reeves had come
into that very same room on the very same kind
of mission. The same, but with a difference. He
has not actually proposed for Katie, but had asked
permission to visit at the house with that intention,
in the event of his love being reciprocated. And
Katie knows all this, and up to the present has
received Walter's attentions, and seemed to take
them as her right. But now all this is set aside,
and a man nearly as old as her father himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">{653}</a></span>
has stepped in and won the girl as a willing
prize. Well may the old sailor marvel! Things
have changed since the days 'long ago,' when
<i>he</i> wooed his wife, and waited nine long years
for her because he could not afford to marry
sooner. His true old-fashioned love has but
intensified as years have sped on; the trials of life
have but drawn the wedded pair closer to each
other. Will this be the experience of Katie and
the Admiral?'</p>

<p>Worthy Mr Grey cannot settle that point; so
he goes up-stairs to hear what Katie herself has to
say on the subject.</p>

<p>Miss Grey lingers in the drawing-room after
the Admiral has gone. There seems something
strangely sad and vague and solemn in the whole
affair, now it has gone so far; and when her
mother comes into the room with Helen leaning
on her arm, she exclaims at once, with glowing
cheeks and flashing eyes and defiant tone: 'Wish
me joy, mother, and Helen! I am going to be
married!'</p>

<p>'I'm glad it is settled at last, Katie; and I hope
you will be very happy. Walter has had plenty of
patience, I'm sure,' says Mrs Grey in her quiet
voice, as she settles Helen comfortably on the sofa
and turns round to give Katie a kiss of congratulation.</p>

<p>But her daughter draws back with a look of
annoyance.</p>

<p>'Why do you talk of Walter? I am not going
to marry <i>him</i>. My intended husband's name
stands far higher in the Navy List. I'm going to
be married to Admiral Sir Herbert Dillworth!'</p>

<p>'Sir Herbert!' exclaim Helen and her mother
together.</p>

<p>'Yes. Why are you surprised?'</p>

<p>'I'm sure we've good reason for surprise, considering
all that has gone on about Walter. Katie,
Katie! what new fancy has hold of you now?'
The voice is Mrs Grey's, the tone one of reproach.</p>

<p>Katie is growing angry. 'The fancy is no new
one, mother. Had you not all been very blind,
you might have guessed what was coming long
ago.'</p>

<p>'Do you really love Sir Herbert?' asks Helen,
with that deep-seeing look of hers, that somehow
always makes her elder sister a little in awe of
her.</p>

<p>'I like him; the rest will come by-and-by; and
I'm glad and proud of my lot.'</p>

<p>There is a ring in Katie's voice, as though she
has flung down the gauntlet of self-approval, and
challenges any one to take it up and contradict
her. Her father is not the one to do this. He
comes into the room at the moment, hears Katie's
asseveration, and feels as if a world of doubt had
rolled away from his mind. Considering his own
word 'his bond,' he judges his daughter by the
same standard. 'That's right, Katie, and sounds
earnest. You may well be proud of your lot, and
of Sir Herbert too: there isn't a better, braver,
more honourable man alive; he's unselfish and
high-principled to his heart's core. I've served
three commissions under him, and ought to know
him well; and I'd rather see a child of mine
lying in her grave, than that she should bring
discredit on his name. Kiss me, my girl! I wish
you happiness. Well may you be proud of our
Admiral!'</p>



<p>Katie receives the kiss just a little impatiently;
she believes she has won 'high stakes,' and does
not relish any doubts on the subject.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CROCODILE_AND_GAVIAL" id="THE_CROCODILE_AND_GAVIAL">THE CROCODILE AND GAVIAL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> species of crocodile inhabit our Indian rivers,
and both are especially numerous in such streams
as the Ganges and its tributaries, the Berhampooter,
and many others. Sir Emerson Tennent,
in his <i>Natural History of Ceylon</i>, points out an
error which Anglo-Indians and others are often
given to&mdash;namely, of applying the term <i>alligator</i>
to animals which are in reality <i>crocodiles</i>. There
are no alligators in the Indian peninsula. The
true alligator is the hideous cayman of South
America, and differs in one or two important
respects from the crocodile of the Nile and Ganges.</p>

<p>The first and by far the most widely distributed
of the two saurians inhabiting our Indian rivers
is the common crocodile, exactly similar to the
animal frequenting the Nile and other streams
of Northern Africa, and known throughout Bengal
by its Hindustani title of 'Mugger.' The second
species is the Gavial or Gurryal (<i>Gavialis Gangeticus</i>).
This reptile is, I believe, only found
in Hindustan, and is indigenous to the Ganges;
hence its specific title.</p>

<p>The habits of the two creatures are in general
very similar, but yet differ in one or two important
points. The mugger often grows to an enormous
size, not unfrequently reaching twenty feet in
length, and is thick built in proportion. The limbs
are short, feet palmated, the fore-feet furnished with
five, the hind with four toes. The head (which in
aspect is extremely hideous) is broad and wedge-shaped,
the muzzle rather narrow, the eyes small,
deep set, and of a villainous glassy green hue.
The jaws when shut lock as closely and firmly
together as a vice. The teeth are of a formidable
description, varying much in size and length.
When the mouth is closed, the tusks in the extremity
of the lower jaw pass completely through and
often project above the tip of the upper. The
body is incased with scaly armour-plates, very
thick and massive on the back, but to a less extent
on the sides of the body. The reptile breathes
through its nostrils, which are situated near the tip
of the snout. By this wonderful provision of
nature, the crocodile is enabled to lie in wait for
its prey with the whole of its body, except the
nostrils, concealed beneath the surface of the
water.</p>

<p>The gavial much resembles the mugger in
general structure (though the body is not usually
so thickly built), with one notable exception, and
that is the totally different shape and character of
the snout. The jaws of the gavial are long, straight,
and narrow; the teeth, which are regular, wide
apart from one another, and even, are of a far less
formidable description than those of the common
crocodile. They much resemble in general appearance
the rows of jagged teeth which garnish
the edges of the upper jaw of the saw-fish. The
snout is often several feet in length, and there
is a peculiar knob or protuberance at the tip; and
the nostrils, as in the other species, are situated
near the extremity.</p>

<p>The gavial has been described by some writers
as 'the scourge of the Ganges' and a 'ferocious
animal;' but I venture to say that this is a highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">{654}</a></span>
exaggerated if not an altogether erroneous statement.
It is possible that occasionally&mdash;though I
am convinced <i>very rarely</i>&mdash;the gavial may seize a
human being; but the reptile is essentially a fish-eater,
and unlike the mugger, is little to be
dreaded by the swimmer or bather. I have frequently,
when strolling along the banks of our
Indian rivers, observed the head of a gavial momentarily
raised above the surface of the water in
the act of swallowing some large fish held transversely
across its jaws, the long beak and rows of
sharp teeth with which nature has furnished it,
greatly assisting the creature in snapping up such
slippery prey.</p>

<p>Crocodiles frequent the wide open channels and
reaches of our large Indian rivers, especially in the
neighbourhood of large towns, such as Dinapore,
Allahabad, or Benares. In such resorts, whole
families of both gavials and muggers may be seen
lying together side by side on points of sand or
low mud islands left dry by the current of the
stream; they delight to bask in the scorching rays
of the mid-day sun.</p>

<p>The animals always lie asleep close to the
margin, and generally with their heads pointing
away from the water. They are extremely watchful;
and on being alarmed by the near approach of
some boat gliding past or human beings walking
along the bank, after contemplating the objects
of their suspicion for a short space of time, they
one after another awkwardly wheel round, and
with a splash and a flounder speedily vanish beneath
the surface of the water, to reappear again so soon
as the cause of their alarm has passed.</p>

<p>Though hideous and repulsive in appearance,
these reptiles nevertheless fulfil a most useful
office as scavengers. In the neighbourhood of
large towns on the banks of the Ganges, hundreds
of dead bodies are daily cast into the holy river
by the Hindus; and in a tropical climate like
India, were it not for crocodiles, turtles, and
vultures assembling and devouring the corpses,
speedily some dreadful plague would break out
and spread death around.</p>

<p>Judging from the accounts of travellers, the
crocodiles inhabiting the African continent must
be far more dangerous than their confrères of Asia;
for though we sometimes hear of muggers taking
to man-eating, especially in Lower Bengal and
parts of Assam, yet such practices are not the
rule, as is generally supposed.</p>

<p>I have, however, seen patches of water near the
foot of ghats or flights of steps fenced round
with a close and strong hedge of bamboo stakes,
driven firmly into the river-bed, for the purpose of
protecting bathers or women drawing water from
the assaults of man-eating crocodiles; and it is a
dangerous practice at all times to bathe in pools
frequented by such monsters. Cows, horses, sheep,
goats, and dogs, besides the numerous wild inhabitants
of the jungle, all form a prey of the mugger.
The cunning animal, well acquainted with some
spot where, towards sunset, flocks and herds, after
the heat of the day has passed, are in the habit of
drinking, there lies in wait concealed amid the sedge
bordering the margin. Presently some unlucky
victim in the shape of a poor bullock parched with
thirst, comes hurrying down the bank and eagerly
approaches the water; but hardly has its mouth
reached the surface, when the blood-thirsty crocodile
seizes it by the nose; and if once successful in
securing a firm grip, the chances are, that unless
the herdsman is at hand to render assistance, the
unfortunate bullock, in spite of struggling desperately
to free itself, is soon dragged down on to its
knees, and later beneath the surface of the pool.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that tigers ere now have been
seized, and after a hard fight, overpowered by the
crocodile. Possibly this may occasionally happen;
but I imagine such an occurrence to be extremely
rare; and my impression is, that such redoubtable
champions, each capable of inflicting severe punishment
on his opponent, would avoid rather than
risk coming to blows.</p>

<p>It is generally imagined that the plated coat of
mail covering the crocodile's body renders the
animal invulnerable to bullets. Such may have
been the case in the days of brown-bess; but a
spinning conical ball fired from a Martini-Henry
or other grooved weapon of the present day, will
not only readily pierce, but even pass completely
through the body of the largest crocodile.</p>

<p>It is the extraordinary tenacity of life with
which all the lizard family are endowed, that has
in a great measure given rise to this notion of
their invulnerability; for unless shot through the
head, neck, heart, or such-like vital part, the
crocodile, even when desperately wounded by a
bullet through the body, will almost invariably
gain the water, only shortly afterwards to sink
dead to the bottom, to be devoured by some of its
cannibal relations.</p>

<p>Near a station where I happened to be quartered
for many years in Central India, there was a large
lake where crocodiles were known yearly to breed.
After some trouble, I procured two mugger's eggs
from some fishermen who frequented the spot.
They were of an oval shape, dirty white colour
and rough surface. The female crocodile about
the month of May, having scraped a hole with
her feet in the sand or mud of some dry island,
deposits her eggs therein, and carefully covers
them up, leaving the heat of the sun to hatch
out her progeny. Meanwhile she hovers about
the spot, till at length the thin layer of sand
covering the eggs upheaves, the young issue forth,
and escorted by the mother, take to their natural
element, the water.</p>

<h2><a name="SHAMROCK_LEAVES" id="SHAMROCK_LEAVES">SHAMROCK LEAVES.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>A WEDDING.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Irish country weddings of the lower orders, the
priest is paid by voluntary contributions of the
wedding guests. The marriage is generally celebrated
in the evening, and is followed, especially
among the farming classes, by a grand festivity, to
which his "Riverince" is always invited. After
supper, when the hearts of the company are merry
with corned beef and greens, roast goose, ham, and
whisky-punch, the hat goes round.</p>

<p>Honor Malone was the prettiest girl in the
barony; and a lucky boy on his marriage day was
the bridegroom; albeit on the occasion he looked
very ill at ease in a stiff, shiny, brand-new, tight-fitting
suit of wedding clothes. Lucky, for in
addition to her good looks, the bride had fifty
pounds to her fortune and three fine cows.</p>

<p>Very pretty and modest she looked seated beside
the priest, blushing a great deal, and wincing not
a little at his Reverence's somewhat broad jokes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">{655}</a></span>
And most becoming was the 'white frock' in
which she was attired; a many-skirted garment,
resplendent with 'bow-knots' and trimmings of
white satin ribbons.</p>

<p>'As good as new,' my lady's-maid at the Castle,
from whom she had bought it, had assured her.
'Made by the grandest French dressmaker in all
London, and worn at only a couple of balls; her
young ladies were so cruel particular, and couldn't
abide the suspicion of a crush or a soil on their
gowns.'</p>

<p>In the midst of his jokes and his jollity (and
with an eye to future dues, nowhere is a priest
half so good-humoured as at a wedding), while
apparently absorbed in attention to the pretty
bride, whose health had just been drunk in a
steaming tumbler, Father Murphy perceived with
his business eye that preparations were being made
for sending round the plate in his behalf.</p>

<p>The stir began at the end of the table where the
'sthrong farmers' mustered thickest. A goodly
set they were, in their large heavy greatcoats of
substantial frieze, corduroy knee-breeches, and
bright blue stockings; their comely dames wearing
the capacious blue or scarlet cloth cloak with silk-lined
hood, which, like the greatcoat of the men,
is an indispensable article in the gala toilet of
their class, even in the dog-days.</p>

<p>In the midst of the group was Jim Ryan.
Now this Jim Ryan was the sworn friend and
adherent of Father Murphy; he would have gone
through fire and water to serve his Reverence. He
was rather a small man in the parish as regarded
worldly goods, having neither snug holding nor
dairy farm; but he was highly popular, being considered
a 'dhroll boy' and good company.</p>

<p>When the proceedings of this devoted follower
met the priest's business eye before alluded to,
they caused considerable surprise to that intelligent
organ, insomuch as greatly to damage a very
pretty compliment his Reverence was in the act of
making to the bride.</p>

<p>First Jim Ryan took hold of the collecting plate,
and seemed about to carry it round. Then, as if
suddenly recollecting himself, he stopped short,
and dashed it down on the table with a clatter and
a bang that made Mrs Malone wince, for it was
one of her best china set.</p>

<p>Jim's next proceeding was to try all his pockets.
He dived into his waistcoat, breeches, and swallow-tailed
coat receptacles, one after another, but without
finding what he wanted. At last, after much
hunting and shaking, and many grimaces of disappointment,
he pounced on the object of his
search, and drew carefully from some unknown
depths a large tattered leather pocket-book.</p>

<p>By this time every one's attention was fixed upon
him. Deliberately he opened the book, and peering
inside&mdash;having first ascertained by a covert
glance around that the company were observing&mdash;he
extracted from it a bank-note. This, when
unfolded, he spread out and flattened ostentatiously
on the table, so that all who looked might read
'Ten Pounds' inscribed upon it!</p>

<p>A flutter of astonishment ran through the guests,
not unmixed with signs of dismay among the richer
portion. Fat pocket-books that a few moments
before were being pompously produced by their
owners, were stealthily thrust back again. A
sudden pause was followed by a great whispering
and consulting among the farmers. Anxious and
meaning looks were bestowed on the latter by
their wives, to say nothing of expressive nudges,
and digs into conjugal ribs where practicable.
For there was always much rivalry in these
offerings. Misther Hennessy, who drove his family
to mass every Sunday in his own jaunting car,
would scorn to give less than Misther Welsh;
though <i>he</i> too was a 'warm' man, and always got
top price for his butter at Limerick market. And
now to be outdone by Jim Ryan! To proffer his
Reverence five pounds, when the likes of him
was giving ten! It was not to be thought of!
So the result, after Jim had deposited his note
with a complacent flourish on the plate, and had
gone his rounds with the latter, was the largest
collection that had ever gladdened the heart or
filled the pockets of Father Murphy.</p>

<p>As the priest was leaving the place, Jim came
up to him and laid his hand on the horse's bridle:
'A good turn I done yer Riverince this night, didn't
I? Such a mort of notes an' silver an' coppers
I niver laid eyes on! I thought the plate would
be bruk in two halves with the weight. An' now'&mdash;in
a whisper, and looking round to see there was
no one listening&mdash;'where's my tin pound note
back for me?'</p>

<p>'Your ten pound note, man! What do you mean
by asking for it? Is it to give you back part of
my dues, you want?</p>

<p>'Ah then now, Father Murphy dear, sure an'
sure you niver was so innocent as to think that
blessed note was mine! Where upon the face of
the living earth would a poor boy like me get
such a sight of money as that? Tin pounds! I
borryed it, yer Riverince, for a schame; an' a
mighty good an' profitable schame it's turned out.
Sure I knew the sight of it would draw the coin
out of all their pockets; an' by the powers! so it
did.' A fact his Reverence could not deny, while&mdash;not
without interest&mdash;he refunded Jim's ingenious
decoy-duck.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ITALIAN_GRIST-TAX" id="THE_ITALIAN_GRIST-TAX">THE ITALIAN GRIST-TAX.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> our own favoured realms millers have their
troubles, no doubt, as well as other folk, but at
anyrate they are not tormented with a <i>grist-tax</i>;
and indeed in these enlightened days we should
have thought that such an impost was unknown
in all countries claiming to have attained a high
degree of civilisation. Mr Edward Herries, C.B.,
late Her Majesty's Secretary of Legation at Rome,
in the course of his elaborate Report on the Financial
System of Italy, has, however, shewn us our
mistake; and in tracing the history and present
position of the tax, he furnishes us with some
curious particulars respecting it.</p>

<p>As our readers will doubtless be struck with
the anomaly of a powerful government having
recourse nowadays to indirect taxation to augment
its revenue, it may be well at the outset to cite a
brief paragraph from Mr Herries' Report, in order
to shew how it happened that the grist-tax came
to be reimposed upon the people of Italy.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year 1865, he writes,
M. Sella, then Minister of Finance, having to meet
a deficit estimated for 1866 at upwards of two
hundred and sixty-one million lire (say ten million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">{656}</a></span>
four hundred and fifty thousand pounds), and
being compelled, he said, to have recourse to indirect
taxation for a large increase of revenue,
urged upon the Chamber of Deputies the revival
of the grist-tax, which he considered as fulfilling
more completely than any other new impost that
could be found the essential conditions of great
productiveness, wide diffusion, and equal pressure
on all parts of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The impost seems to have made its first appearance
in Sicily, where it was a source of revenue
during the Norman period, and there, no one was
allowed to carry corn to be ground without first
obtaining, after much delay, a permit, for which
he had to pay the duty chargeable on the grinding
of the corn. The attestation of the officer in
charge of the mill was requisite for the removal of
the flour, for which a certain route was prescribed,
and which was always to be accompanied by the
permit. The miller was not even allowed to keep
the key of his own mill, and was prohibited from
grinding corn between sunset and sunrise. The
wants of the population, however, sometimes made
it necessary to relax this rule; and in such cases the
miller (whose family was never to remain in the
mill with him) was securely locked and barred in
for the night, without any means of communicating
with the outer world, whatever might happen. This
treatment, however, was at length seen to be cruel;
and permission was granted to any miller exposed
to imminent peril from fire, flood, or other calamity,
to free himself from nocturnal incarceration
by breaking (if he could) through the door, window,
or roof. It does not seem to have been foreseen,
Mr Herries aptly remarks, that such a gracious
concession might be rendered nugatory by the
strength of the barriers or the feebleness of the
miller!</p>

<p>Up to 1842, the millers themselves were
considered as responsible fiscal agents; but after
that time, the supervision of every mill was intrusted
to an official called a 'weigher' (<i>custode
pesatore</i>); but not being usually a very faithful
guardian, bribery soon became rampant. In the
Ecclesiastical State, where the tax was farmed
out to contractors, the mode of its exaction was in
many respects similar to that existing in Sicily.
By an edict of 1801, which deserves notice
as a legislative curiosity, a miller was liable to
be sent to the galleys, besides paying a heavy
fine, for a variety of offences&mdash;such as that of
grinding corn not regularly consigned to him in
the manner prescribed; of receiving corn or sending
out flour at night; and others of similar
enormity. In the district of the Agro Romano,
all bread had to be stamped; and the absence
of the proper stamp exposed the guilty baker
to a fine of one hundred scudi and corporal
punishment, or even to slavery in the galleys.
The inhabitants of this district were only allowed
to use bread baked within it, and they might
be compelled to declare where they got their
bread.</p>

<p>Though the tax was temporarily abolished in its
last strongholds in the year 1860, it was subsequently
revived, until all the statutes relating to
the subject were finally consolidated in 1874.
The tax, which must now be paid to the miller
at the time of grinding, is charged at the rate
of two lire (of about tenpence each) per hundred
kilograms on wheat; and one lira on maize, rye,
oats, and barley. The miller pays periodically
to the collector of taxes a corresponding fixed
charge for every hundred revolutions of the
millstone, to be ascertained by an instrument
called <i>contatore</i>, which is affixed to the shaft at
the cost of the government. The amount of
this charge is determined for every mill according
to the quality and force of the machinery and
the mode of grinding. The miller may refuse the
rate as first calculated; in which case the revenue
authorities have the power to employ an instrument
which will record the weight or volume of
the corn ground; or of collecting the tax directly
by their own officers, or of farming the tax. Should
they not think fit to exercise such powers, the rate
is determined by experts. The impost, it is perhaps
hardly necessary to say, is an eminently
unpopular one, and was only consented to under
the pressure of extreme necessity.</p>

<p>The great difficulty in the way of the smooth
working of the grist-tax was the impossibility of
procuring the mechanical means of control contemplated
by the law; and in point of fact, when
it came into operation no effective instrument was
in existence. By the end of August 1871, however,
matters had changed, and no fewer than 78,250
registering instruments were supplied, and by 1874
the greater number of these <i>contatori</i> were in active
operation. The <i>contatore</i>, however, does not give
universal satisfaction; and Mr Herries thinks that
what is wanted to remove doubts as to fair treatment,
is some instrument capable of recording the
weight or the quantity of wheat ground. Best of
all would be the abolition of the grist-tax; but in
a country where the mass of the people consume
no articles of luxury which can be taxed by revenue
officers, and also from whom no direct impost
could be exacted, the continuation of the grist-tax
seems to be an absolute necessity.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
